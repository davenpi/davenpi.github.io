Hi! I'm Ian. I'm currently living in the Boston area and just finished up my Physics PhD at Harvard Univeristy.
I grew up in a small town in Virginia and spent most of my childhood thinking about sports and hanging out with friends. Doing a physics PhD never crossed my mind. Not once. Nonetheless I just finished my degree. I've learned a lot and met some incredible people along the way. Now I'm off to be a scientist at a [startup](https://engine.xyz/companies/reynko) trying to commercialize a big breakthrough in understanding turbulence. Check out some of my [hobbies](/hobbies/), [goals](/pie/), and past [research](/research/). Reach out if you see anything interesting!
