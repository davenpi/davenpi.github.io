Hi! I'm Ian. I'm currently living in the Boston area and finishing up my Physics PhD at Harvard Univeristy.
I grew up in a small town in Virginia and would never have predicted this, living in a big city doing physics of all things, is where I'd be at 27. That's life and I'm grateful for what I've found along the way. The original plan was to study business. Now the plan is to return to the business world and use the skills I've developed to do something great. More on that to come. Check out some of my [research](/research/), [hobbies](/hobbies/),
and [goals](/dreams/) and reach out if you see anything interesting!
