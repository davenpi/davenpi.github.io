Hi! I'm Ian. I'm currently living in the Boston area and finishing up my Physics PhD at Harvard Univeristy.
I grew up in a small town in Virginia and spent most of my childhood thinking about sports and hanging out. I can't say I had clear expectations, but I'm certain doing a physics PhD never crossed my mind. Doing physics has totally changed how I think and helped me meet a bunch of great people. Now the plan is to use the skills I've developed to help build something interesting and useful. More on that to come. Check out some of my [research](/research/), [hobbies](/hobbies/),
and [goals](/dreams/) and reach out if you see anything interesting!
