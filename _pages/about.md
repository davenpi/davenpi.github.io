Hi! I'm Ian. I'm currently living in the Boston area and finishing up my Physics PhD at Harvard Univeristy.
I grew up in a small town in Virginia and did my Bachelor's at James Madison University. I started
out as a business major and ended up doing a Physics PhD. Life's weird. 
Now it's time to return to the business world and use the skills I've developed to try 
and do something great. More on that to come. Check out some of my [research](/research/), [hobbies](/hobbies/),
and [goals](/dreams/) and reach out if you see anything interesting!
