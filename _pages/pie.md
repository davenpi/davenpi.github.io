I think a lot about the things I would like to accomplish in my life and how I can be the kind
of person who deserves them. Health, peace of mind, indpendence of thought, 
and loving relationships are most important to me. Those are daily projects. After that there are some 
things I would really love to achieve. Some of these I'm much closer to than others. They aren't 
perfect measures of what would lead to a great life, but it's useful to have something measurable. Reach out
if you've done any of these or want to try together.


## Finish my PhD and publish all of the projects I am currently working on

- **Current Progress**: The Kiiking paper is written. I need to polish some results for the snake project and the glider project. The coin project needs work.


- **Major obstacles**: Focus. There are also other obligations for the PhD not directly
related to producing results (e.g. writing a thesis).


- **Timeline**: Kiiking paper (before Apr 15). Glider paper (before Apr 25). Snake paper (before May). Coin paper (end of May).

## Bike [Skyline Drive](https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/driving-skyline-drive.htm), from Dickey Ridge Visitor Center onwards, in a day

- **Current Progress**: I've biked about 1/10 of it so far. I think this is doable in the near term i.e. within a year or so. Starting
at Dickey Ridge makes the trip much easier and more beautiful. The first few miles before that have no views and are a treacherous
climb.


- **Major obstacles**: About 9,000 feet of elevation gain. I really don't know what that will feel like.


- **Timeline**: Spring/Summer 2024

## Build something useful. Use the money to have fun and help others.
I'm thinking a company here. I'll use the proceeds to fund my adventures and start an investment company which invests 
in both companies and basic research. I will also start some kind of scholarship to help young people discover new heights
for themselves.  

- **Current Progress**: On the scholarship front I have a plan to set aside $10k 
to help a young person (who couldn't afford it otherwise) get started in aviation. I think that would be 
meaningful and a good initial step in making all of this real. 


- **Major obstacles**: Courage. Understanding myself and what the best path through all of this is for me.


- **Timeline**: Join a startup or other group working on something meaningful (Spring/Summer 2023). Aviation scholarship (Winter 2023). 
My own thing/a thing I own a big piece of (Before 2025). The whole shebang (Hard to estimate. Before 2035).

## Become an Earthrounder
[Earthrounders](https://www.earthrounders.com/index.php) are a group of pilots who have flown all the way around the 
world in a light aircraft.

- **Current Progress**: Have solo'd three times. I have a pilot friend who says he
is willing to do it together.


- **Major obstacles**: Money for an airplane. Time off. An instrument rating.


- **Timeline**: Private license (Spring/Summer 2023). Instrument rating (Early 2025). Buy a plane and do the trip (Hard to estimate. Before 2035).

I will update this as I think of more...
