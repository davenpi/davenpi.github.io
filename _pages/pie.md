<!-- I think a lot about the things I would like to accomplish in my life and how I can be the kind
of person who deserves them. Of course there are the daily projects: health, peace of mind, indpendence of thought, 
and loving relationships. After that there are some 
things I would really love to achieve.  -->
Here's a few crazy and not so crazy things I'd love to do. Reach out if you want to try together.

 <!-- ## Finish my PhD and ~~publish all of the projects I am currently working on~~

- **Current Progress**: Defended thesis. The Kiiking paper is written. We are working on putting out one more paper I was working on but i'm moving 


- **Major obstacles**: Focus.


- **Timeline**: Thesis defense (May 2). Kiiking paper (before May 25). Glider paper (before May 25). Snake paper (before May 25). -->



<!-- 
## Bike all of [Skyline Drive](https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/driving-skyline-drive.htm) in a weekend.

- **Current Progress**: I've biked about 1/10 of it so far.


- **Timeline**: Summer 2024.

## Buy a plane and fly around the world. Eventually become an Earthrounder
[Earthrounders](https://www.earthrounders.com/index.php) are a group of pilots who have flown all the way around the 
world in a light aircraft (less than 15,000 lbs).

- **Current Progress**: 47 hours of flight time. -->


<!-- - **Major obstacles**: Money for an airplane. Time off. -->

<!-- 
- **Timeline**: Private license (Spring/Summer 2023). Instrument rating (Mid/Late 2024). Buy a plane (2026-2027). Do the trip around the world (Hard to estimate. Before 2035).


## Build a business which does something useful and interesting. Use the money to have fun and help others.
I'll use the proceeds to fund my adventures, start an angel investment/venture capital company, and start a nonprofit
which invests in basic research. I'll also start some kind of scholarship to help young people discover new possibilities for themselves.  

- **Current Progress**: Joined a startup. -->


<!-- - **Major obstacles**: Courage. Understanding myself and what the best path through all of this is for me. -->


<!-- - **Timeline**: Aviation scholarship (Spring/Summer 2024). My own thing/a thing I own a big piece of (next couple of years). The whole shebang (Hard to estimate. Before 2035).
