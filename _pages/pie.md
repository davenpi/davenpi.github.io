description: some things I would love to do

I think a lot about the things I would like to accomplish in my life and how I can be the kind
of person who deserves them. At the deepest level peace of mind, indpendence of thought, 
and loving relationships are most important to me. Those are daily projects. After that, and assuming I stay healthy, 
there are some things I think would really love to achieve. Some of these I'm much closer to than others. They aren't 
perfect measures of what would lead to a great life, but it's useful to have something measurable. Reach out
if you've done any of these or want to try together.


## PhD
- [ ] Finish my PhD and publish all of the projects I am currently working on. 
    - **Current Progress**: Although I'm very close to graduating (May 2023) my PhD has not gone as expected. Much of that is
    due to my own ignorance. In the end I scrambled to pull some projects together, but to be proud of my efforts I need 
    to publish everything I am currently working on (glider, snake, coin, kiiking).
    - **Major obstacles**: Focus and competing timelines for the job search. There are also other obligations for the PhD not directly
    related to producing results (e.g. writing a thesis).
    - **Timeline**: End of May 2023.

## Fitness/Adventure
- [ ] Bike all of [Skyline Drive](https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/driving-skyline-drive.htm) in a day
    - **Current Progress**: I've biked about 1/10 of it so far. I think this is doable in the near term i.e. within a year or so.
    - **Major obstacles**: There's a tough stretch in the beginning at the Front Royal entrance that could eat a lot of time. There
    are problably others as well. I need to do more cardio and make a plan. Also finding a buddy to do it with would be great.
    - **Timeline**: Spring/Summer 2024

## How I make a living
- [ ] Be a part of building something meaningful and useful. Ideally making a lot of money in the process. Use the proceeds to fund
my adventures and start an investment company (sort of a mix between Venture Capital and the Simons Foundation). Also start some kind
of scholarship to help young people discover new possibilities.  
    - **Current Progress**: To be frank I'm basically all potential at this point. I've never had a job for more than a few months or 
    built a business. I have developed the skill of working independently on problems that no one has solved before as a part of my PhD.
    I think the life lessons I learned from that will be helpful. On the scholarship front I have a plan to set aside $10k 
    to help a young person (who couldn't afford it otherwise) get started in aviation. I think that would be meaningful and be a good 
    initial step in making all of this real.
    - **Major obstacles**: Courage. It feels unholy and presumptive to even write this down. Understanding myself and what the best path towards 
    all of this actually is for me. Maintaining a high bar on my work ethic and clarity of thought.
    - **Timeline**: Join a startup or other group working on something meaningful (Spring/Summer 2023). Aviation scholarship (Winter 2023). 
    My own thing/a thing I own a big piece of (Before 2025). The whole shebang (Hard to estimate. Before 2035).

## Insanity
- [ ] Become an [earthrounder](https://www.earthrounders.com/are_you_one.php). Earthrounders are a group of
pilots who have flown all the way around the world in a light aircraft.
    - **Current Progress**: Have had first solo flight. I do also have a pilot friend who says he
    is willing to do it together.
    - **Major obstacles**: Money for an airplane. Time off. An instrument rating.
    - **Timeline**: Private license (Spring/Summer 2023). Instrument rating (Early 2025). Buy a plane and do the trip (Hard to estimate. Before 2035).

I will update this if I think of more...
