I think a lot about the things I would like to accomplish in my life and how I can be the kind
of person who deserves them. At the deepest level health, peace of mind, indpendence of thought, 
and loving relationships are most important to me. Those are daily projects. After that there are some 
things I would really love to achieve. Some of these I'm much closer to than others. They aren't 
perfect measures of what would lead to a great life, but it's useful to have something measurable. Reach out
if you've done any of these or want to try together.


## Finish my PhD and publish all of the projects I am currently working on

- **Current Progress**: Although I'm very close to graduating (May 2023) my PhD has not gone as expected. Much of that is
due to my own ignorance. In the end I scrambled to pull some projects together, but to be proud of my efforts I need 
to publish everything I am currently working on (glider, snake, coin, kiiking).


- **Major obstacles**: Focus and competing timelines for the job search. There are also other obligations for the PhD not directly
related to producing results (e.g. writing a thesis).


- **Timeline**: End of May 2023.

## Bike all of [Skyline Drive](https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/driving-skyline-drive.htm) in a day

- **Current Progress**: I've biked about 1/10 of it so far. I think this is doable in the near term i.e. within a year or so.


- **Major obstacles**: There's a tough stretch in the beginning at the Front Royal entrance that could eat a lot of time. There
are problably others as well. I need to do more cardio and make a plan. Also finding a buddy to do it with would be great.


- **Timeline**: Spring/Summer 2024

## Help build something meaningful and useful. Ideally making a lot of money in the process
I do have a number in mind. I'll use the proceeds to fund my adventures and start an investment company (sort of a mix between Venture Capital and the Simons Foundation). 
Also start some kind of scholarship to help young people discover new possibilities.  

- **Current Progress**: On the scholarship front I have a plan to set aside $10k 
to help a young person (who couldn't afford it otherwise) get started in aviation. I think that would be 
meaningful and a good initial step in making all of this real. 


- **Major obstacles**: Courage. Understanding myself and what the best path through 
all of this is for me. Etc.


- **Timeline**: Join a startup or other group working on something meaningful (Spring/Summer 2023). Aviation scholarship (Winter 2023). 
My own thing/a thing I own a big piece of (Before 2025). The whole shebang (Hard to estimate. Before 2035).

## Become an Earthrounder
[Earthrounders](https://www.earthrounders.com/index.php) are a group of pilots who have flown all the way around the 
world in a light aircraft.

- **Current Progress**: Have solo'd twice. I have a pilot friend who says he
is willing to do it together.


- **Major obstacles**: Money for an airplane. Time off. An instrument rating.


- **Timeline**: Private license (Spring/Summer 2023). Instrument rating (Early 2025). Buy a plane and do the trip (Hard to estimate. Before 2035).

I will update this as I think of more...
