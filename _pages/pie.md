I think a lot about the things I would like to accomplish in my life and how I can be the kind
of person who deserves them. Of course there are the daily projects: health, peace of mind, indpendence of thought, 
and loving relationships. After that there are some 
things I would really love to achieve. Some of these I'm much closer to than others. They aren't 
perfect measures of what would lead to a great life, but it's useful to have something measurable. Reach out
if you've done any of these or want to try together.


## Finish my PhD and publish all of the projects I am currently working on

- **Current Progress**: The Kiiking paper is written. I need to polish some results for the snake project and the glider project.


- **Major obstacles**: Focus.


- **Timeline**: Thesis defense (May 2). Kiiking paper (before May 25). Glider paper (before May 25). Snake paper (before May 25).

## Bike all of [Skyline Drive](https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/driving-skyline-drive.htm) in a weekend.

- **Current Progress**: I've biked about 1/10 of it so far. I think this is doable in the near term i.e. within a year or so. Doing the whole thing in a day would be tough but I'm not sure what carrying camping gear would be like
for an overnight stay. I'll try this out soon.

- **Major obstacles**: About 11,000 feet of elevation gain. Finding a partner in crime.


- **Timeline**: A few attempts summer 2023. At the latest Spring/Summer 2024.


## Build a business which does something useful and interesting. Use the money to have fun and help others.
I'll use the proceeds to fund my adventures, start an angel investment/venture capital company, and start a nonprofit
which invests in basic research. I'll also start some kind of scholarship to help young people discover new possibilities for themselves.  

- **Current Progress**: On the scholarship front I have a plan to set aside $5-10k 
to help a young person (who couldn't afford it otherwise) get started in aviation. I think that would be 
meaningful and a good initial step in making all of this real. 


- **Major obstacles**: Courage. Understanding myself and what the best path through all of this is for me.


- **Timeline**: Join a startup or other group working on something meaningful (Spring/Summer 2023). Aviation scholarship (Winter 2023). My own thing/a thing I own a big piece of (next couple of years). The whole shebang (Hard to estimate. Before 2035).

## Buy a plane and fly around the world. Eventually become an Earthrounder
[Earthrounders](https://www.earthrounders.com/index.php) are a group of pilots who have flown all the way around the 
world in a light aircraft (less than 15,000 lbs).

- **Current Progress**: Have solo'd four times. I have a pilot friend who says he is willing to do it together.


- **Major obstacles**: Money for an airplane. Time off. An instrument rating.


- **Timeline**: Private license (Spring/Summer 2023). Instrument rating (Mid/Late 2024). Buy a plane (2026-2027). Do the trip around the world (Hard to estimate. Before 2035).

I will update this as I think of more...
