I've traveled mostly in Europe and around the US. In Europe I've been to

 - Czech Republic (only Prague. Super pretty and fairly cheap. Was very cold when I went though. Cover photo) 
 - England
 - Spain 
 - Portugal
 - Germany
 - Switzerland
 - Italy
 - Netherlands. 

Sadly I can't find most of the pictures I have from those trips but here's me looking confused near a cliff in Sagres, Portugal.

Most of those were only for a few days at a time but I've spent fairly sizable periods of time in Berlin, Germany and Genoa, Italy.
All things considered Berlin is the coolest city I've been in (pretty, dynamic, green, historic, easy for English speakers, accessible, etc). 
I recommend it.

In the US my main mode of travel has been the road trip. Particularly in the West (CO, UT, NV, CA, AZ). I love bouncing aruond from National Park to National Park
and there is a huge density of them in the states I mentioned.
Road tripping is a fun way to experience the US and appreciate how unbelivably big it is. Just have a good road trip partner and hope they have good taste in music.
Also camping out in the parks is great. You feel like a part of a welcoming community.
And it's cheap once you have a tent.

Also I've seen parts of Canada (Vancouver and Montreal)
