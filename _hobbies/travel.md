I've traveled mostly in Europe and around the US. In Europe I've been to

 - Czech Republic (Cover photo) 
 - England
 - Spain 
 - Portugal
 - Germany
 - Switzerland
 - Italy
 - Austria
 - Netherlands

I can't find most of the pictures I have from those trips, but here's me struggling up a mountain in Switzerland (possibly Austria)

and me looking confused at a beach in Sagres, Portugal.

I like to visit the cities and just walk around all day. I just happen to have two pictures of me looking exasperated in the outdoors. It's not always like that.


Most of those trips were only for a few days, but I've spent fairly sizable periods of time in Berlin, Germany and Genoa, Italy.
All things considered Berlin is the coolest city I've been in (it's pretty, dynamic, green, historic, easy for English speakers, accessible, etc). 
I recommend it.

In the US my main mode of travel has been the road trip. I've done two reasonably long ones in the West (CO, UT, NV, CA, AZ). I love bouncing around 
from National Park to National Park, and there is a huge density of them in the states I mentioned.
Road tripping is a fun way to experience the US and appreciate how unbelievably big it is. Just have a good road trip partner and hope they have good taste in music.
Also camping out in the parks is great. You feel like a part of a community and it's cheap.

I've also been to parts of Canada (Vancouver and Montreal)

Here's me in Montreal with le cowboy squelette
