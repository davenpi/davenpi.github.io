I've traveled mostly in Europe and around the US. In Europe I've been to

 - Czech Republic (only Prague. Super pretty and fairly cheap. Was very cold when I went though. Cover photo) 
 - England
 - Spain 
 - Portugal
 - Germany
 - Switzerland
 - Italy
 - Austria
 - Netherlands. 

Sadly I can't find most of the pictures I have from those trips but here's me struggling up a mountain in Switzerland

and me looking confused near a cliff in Sagres, Portugal.

I like to visit the cities in Europe and just walk around all day. I just so happen to have two pictures of me looking exasperated in the outdoors. It's not always like that.


Most of those trips were only for a few days at a time, but I've spent fairly sizable periods of time in Berlin, Germany and Genoa, Italy.
All things considered Berlin is the coolest city I've been in (it's pretty, dynamic, green, historic, easy for English speakers, accessible, etc). 
I recommend it.

In the US my main mode of travel has been the road trip. Particularly in the West (CO, UT, NV, CA, AZ). I love bouncing aruond from National Park to National Park,
and there is a huge density of them in the states I mentioned.
Road tripping is a fun way to experience the US and appreciate how unbelievably big it is. Just have a good road trip partner and hope they have good taste in music.
Also camping out in the parks is great. I felt like a part of a safe and welcoming community but we never really talked with anyone else.
And it's cheap once you have a tent.

I've also been to parts of Canada (Vancouver and Montreal)

Here's me with le cowboy squelette.
