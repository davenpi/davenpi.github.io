Sports are a long running passion of mine. Playing and watching. I'm best at basketball but I'm game for most things (cover photo is me attempting to water ski behind my friend Sean's boat). I've gotten much more interested in squash lately (harvard, right?). I also got a nice road bike during the pandemic. My home in VA is about 30 minutes from Shenandoah National Park so I like to go for long rides on Skyline Drive when I'm there. I haven't done the whole thing yet but I plan to. Hiking is also great. The last hike I went on (mount tripyramid in NH) I slipped and slid down a sheer rock face for a few long seconds. I've been much less motivated to hike since then.

Sadly I'm committed to the Washington Commanders. Them being so bad helped me stop wasting so much time watching football though. Definitely want to try to go to the major events in most sports though (world cup, wimbledon, nba finals, f1 race, etc). It'd be a fun way to travel.

Reach out if you want to play some hoops, squash, or whatever. Will play horse for money.
