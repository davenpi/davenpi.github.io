I'm working on my Private Pilot's License. My first solo was March 27, 2023. As of this writing I have about 30 hours of flying time. 40 is the minimum to get the license.

Flying is insane and great. I hope to get my license around June and go on as
many trips as I can with family and friends. Reach out if you're interested
in aviation or are a pilot yourself! Tips on getting cheap flight time and great places to fly much appreciated.
