Then there is everything else. Cooking is great, particularly with others. My most recent new recipe is Risotto.

I'm trying to explore new kinds of music so I recently went to the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

Love movies. Harvard has a Film Archive where they show classic films. I saw Amarcord by Fellini there and really enjoyed it so 
I am much more willing to try old movies than I was before.

Dancing is also be great. I'm still a shy and somewhat reserved dancer but I'm getting better! 
Bachata/salsa social dance nights at Havana night club in Cambridge are a good time.

Much more...
