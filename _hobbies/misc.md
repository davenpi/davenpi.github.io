Then there is everything else. 

Poker is a fun occasionally. I have played in Vegas. I'm not great and I play really tight so it was a grind.
This picture is not that.

Cooking is great. Particularly with others. A new recipe I like is Risotto.

I'm trying to explore new kinds of music so I recently went to the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

I love movies. Harvard has a Film Archive where they show classic films. The best movie I saw there was Amarcord by Fellini.

Dancing is fun. I'm still a shy and somewhat reserved dancer but I'm getting better! 
Bachata/salsa social dance nights at Havana night club in Cambridge are a good time.

What else should I try?
