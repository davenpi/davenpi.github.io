Then there is everything else. Cooking is great, particularly with others. My most recent new recipe is Risotto.

I like to try new things so I recently went to the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

Love movies (Harvard has a Film Archive where they show classic films. I saw Amarcord by Fellini there and really enjoyed it so 
I am much more willing to try old movies than I was before.)

Dancing can also be great. Bachata/salsa social dance nights at Havana night club in Cambridge are a good time.

Much more...
