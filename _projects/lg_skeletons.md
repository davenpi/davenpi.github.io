I used to want to do research in quantum field theory and string theory. This was my first and only project
in that domain. I will say a few brief words about that. Basically we converted this problem of classifying
theories in physics into a math problem. I solved the math problem. Why exactly these theories are important
and relevant is not clear. Check the paper if you're interested.
