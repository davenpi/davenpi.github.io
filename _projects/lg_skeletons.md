In a past life I thought I wanted to do research in quantum field theory and string theory. Quantum Field Theory
is incredibly cool because it's the deepest description of reality that we have. The way human beings understand
things like electrons and light and the fundamental forces of nature are best described by Quantum Field Theories.
We even built huge [particle accelerators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN) deep underground in Switzerland to 
test the predictions of the theory. It's incredibly accurate as a theory of nature. 

I was very lucky to meet a great physicist and [mentor, Dr. Ilarion Melnikov,](https://www.jmu.edu/physics/people/all-people/melnikov-ilarion.shtml) 
in my undergraduate days who helped me learn a lot about the quantum world and what it's like to do research in it. 
We even worked on a project together and published the results. 


## The project

Quantum field theory and it's extensions are super deep and there was no way I was going to get my head around all of
the complexity as an undergraduate.
Luckily for me Ilarion was able to reduce a lot of the complexity and pose a solvable research problem. In the end we 
wanted to try and classify a set of theories that are described by polynomials (some functions in math). My job was simply 
to find all the polynomials that satisfied certain properties.
After some hard work over a summer we were able to produce a paper called 
[Landau-Ginzburg Skeletons](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/JHEP05(2017)050) (Landau and Ginzburg being two
great physiscists of former times who made important early developments in the theory). Obviously Ilarion wrote the paper but
I did actually contribute to the meat of the results presented in the writing.
